### Context

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:  

- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG
- Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

Take the mtcars data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.
